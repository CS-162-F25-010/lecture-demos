Software design is the practice of creating software design models prior to
	implementation.

The goal of software design is twofold:
1) Figure out the low-level details
2) Figure out how those low-level details can work together to achieve
	the high-level objective



One option is to use pseudocode. Basically English text that kind of looks
like code.

if x is less than five:
	print something to the terminal



So, how do we figure out the pseudocode?

One very common methodology to software design is known as top-down design.
The idea of top-down design is to start with the high-level goals, and break
them down each into just a couple of slightly smaller steps / components.

Then you figure out how those components work together to solve the entire
problem.

Then, you rinse and repeat with the smaller components. You look at each
smaller component, and you break it down into a few slightly smaller components.

You keep doing this until you have components that no longer need to be
broken down any further. That's when your design is complete.
