Software design. One part of software design is evaluating code quality.

Good vs bad code is complicated. Readability, modularity / reusability,
maintainability (how easy it is to maintain, update the codebase), performance,
scalability.

Maintainability is our focus. A question of "how easy is it to change this code?"

Encapsulation is a philosophy of code writing that can help improve
maintainability. The theme is this: Encapsulation is, in some sense, the
practice of "co-locating" or "bundling" data with the behavior that operates
on that data.

Encapsulation can help improve a codebase's maintainability. It can do this
in two main ways: 1) it can help reign in coupling; 2) it can help establish
class invariants.

Coupling. Coupling describes a situation where modifying one piece of code
requires modifying one or more OTHER pieces of code in addition. Coupling
can make your code harder to change.

There are various degrees and types of coupling. Coupling is often described
as "loose" or "tight". Coupling can be "local" or "pervasive".

Global variables often introduce tight, pervasive coupling where it isn't
really necessary.

Coupling is not really evil. It's inevitable. However:
1. Some coupling is unnecessary.
2. Coupling can often be isolated / contained.
3. Coupling can often be moved around such that the components of code
	with the largest amount of coupling are also the components of
	code that need to change the least frequently.

Object-oriented programming.
