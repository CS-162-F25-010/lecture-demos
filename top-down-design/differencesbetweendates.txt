The problem that we want to solve: Given two dates, D1 and D2, determine the
amount of days between them

Ex: What is the difference between 11/22/2025 and 11/19/2025? The answer
	would be 3

Much harder ex: What is the difference between 11/21/2025 and 11/21/1999



Top-down fashion: We start with the high-level objective, we break it down into
a few smaller components, we figure out how those components interact, then
we proceed in turn with those smaller components


If D1 and D2 are in the same year:
	return difference_between_dates_within_same_year(D1, D2)
else:
	Let's assume D1 < D2
	total_difference = difference_between_dates_within_same_year(D1, Dec 31 of the year containing D1)
	total_difference += 1
	for each year y between D1 and D2, exclusive
		total_difference += days_within_year(y)
	total_difference += difference_between_dates_within_same_year(Jan 1 of the year containing D2, D2)


Goal: Write pseudocode for a function / code component that determines the
number of days in a given year. It does not have to handle all the low-level
details; just a small breakdown of some of the high-level steps.
