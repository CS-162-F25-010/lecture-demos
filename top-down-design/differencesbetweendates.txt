The problem that we want to solve: Given two dates, date1 and date2, determine the
amount of days between them

Ex: What is the difference between 11/22/2025 and 11/19/2025? The answer
    would be 3

Much harder ex: What is the difference between 11/21/2025 and 11/21/1999

Top-down fashion: We start with the high-level objective, we break it down into
a few smaller components, we figure out how those components interact, then
we proceed in turn with those smaller components







# Computes difference between two dates
days_between_dates(date1, date2):
    If date1 and date2 are in the same year:
        return days_between_dates_in_year(date1, date2)
    else:
        Let's assume date1 < date2
        total_difference = days_between_dates_in_year(date1, Dec 31 of the year containing date1)
        total_difference += 1
        for each year y between date1 and date2, exclusive
            total_difference += number_of_days_in_year(y)
        total_difference += days_between_dates_in_year(Jan 1 of the year containing date2, date2)




# Computes the number of days in the given year y
number_of_days_in_year(y):
    if is_leap_year(y):
        return 366
    otherwise:
        return 365




# Determines whether a given year is a leap year
is_leap_year(y):
    # A leap year occurs every year that's a multiple of 4,
    # except for years that are divisible by 100 but not 400.
    # (Yes, this is a true fact. See the below reference.)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

    if y is divisible by 4:
        if y is divisible by 100 and y is not divisible by 400:
            return false
        otherwise:
            return true
    otherwise:
        return false # Not divisible by 4




# Computes the number of days between two Dates that take place
# in the same year as each other.
days_between_dates_in_year(date1, date2):
    if date1's month is the same as date2's month:
        return date2's day - date1's day
    otherwise:
        answer = days_in_month(date1's month) - date1's day # To get to the end of date1's month
        answer = answer + 1 # To get to the first of the NEXT month
        for each month m between date1 and date2 (exclusive):
            answer = answer + days_in_month(m, date1's year) # To get past month m
        answer = answer + date2's day - 1 # To get to date2's day




# Computes the number of days in the given month m, for the given year y
days_in_month(m, y):
    if m is in ['Sep', 'Apr', 'June', 'Nov']:
        return 30 # These months all have 30 days
    otherwise if m is NOT 'Feb':
        return 31 # These months all have 31 days
    otherwise:
        # m must be February. If it's a leap year, it has 29 days.
        # Otherwise, it has 28 days.
        if is_leap_year(y):
            return 29
        otherwise:
            return 28
